    {
      "component": "Navigation",
      "challenge": "Multi-page navigation with active state and mobile menu",

      "mitigation": "Use structured layout: problem, solution, results with metrics. Include visual elements and client quotes."
    },
    {
      "component": "ContactForm",
      "challenge": "Multi-step form with validation and user-friendly experience",

  "fixerContext": {
    "expectedStructure": "Simple Next.js app. Components in components/ folder at root. app/page.tsx imports from ../components/",
    "importPaths": "Use '../components/ComponentName' from app/page.tsx",
    "commonIssues": [
      "Import path mismatches - ensure all imports use '../components/' from app/page.tsx",
      "Missing 'use client' directive for interactive components (Navigation menu, ContactForm, PortfolioGrid filter)",
      "Image optimization - use Next.js Image component with proper width/height",
      "Link components - use next/link for internal navigation between pages",
      "Responsive design - ensure grid layouts work on mobile with proper breakpoints",
      "Color consistency - verify all pages use the same color variables/classes",
      "Navigation active states - implement pathname checking for current page highlighting",
      "Form validation - ensure ContactForm has proper error handling and validation",
      "Component reusability - Header and Footer should be identical across all pages",
      "Content relationships - ensure home page previews link to full content on other pages"
